"# C-Project" 
Circuit analyser that can read .dat files and output the Thevinen equivalent voltage along with other circuit components.

Some added functionality includes the ability to determine SI units.

Further functionality will be to print the circuit with dashs and veritcal lines, and to read other .dat files that are associated with circuit reading.
